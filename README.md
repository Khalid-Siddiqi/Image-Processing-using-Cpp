# Image-Processing-using-Cpp
One of the main goals of this project is to prove that Image processing in C++ is also possible.
We did research and found out that image processing in C++ is a lot simpler and easier to do.
We took our logic from Linear Algebra while seeing the image as a Matrix the possibilities of possible outcomes are many 
it's only a matter of a person’s imagination to define limits to it. 
## Goal:
This project will help user to process images by
letting them use filters, transform, color grade, reflection, denoising and many other processes on the image.
## Features:
These are previously mentioned features in the proposal:
*	Auto Enhance
*	Reflection
*	Image filtering
*	Shear
*	Image Denoising
*	Rotation
*	Negative
*	Blurring
*	Cropping
## Tools and Technology:
The language used will be C++ and IDE Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code were primarily used,
as opposed to the proposed DEV CPP IDE was unable to support the libraries that were required in this project.
We used the OpenCV library and CMAKE library in the project.
## Project discription:
The demand for “Digital Image Processing” is increasing every day.
But there are not many products in the market that solve the ever-increasing demand for image processing.
Our project will utilize the advanced concept of data structure and algorithms to create and apply complex calculations on large data sets. 
This project will help user to process his/her image files to add filters, transformation, color grading, reflection, and many more features upon them.
The following project will also utilize advanced concepts of Linear algebra to enhance the precision and working of the program.
##Refrence Books:
These books prove to be a lot of help for us:
*	Learning Image Processing with OpenCV by 
Gloria Bueno García Oscar Deniz Suarez José Luis Espinosa Aranda Jesus Salido Tercero Ismael Serrano Gracia Noelia Vállez Enano
*	Elementary Linear Algebra 12 Edition by HOWARD ANTON and ANTON KAUL
